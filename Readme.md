# ROTOS
This is a toy operating system in Rust.

This repo is a personal work and a pastime for the author. However, as the author
no loner study Operating System but other fields now, the repo will may not be updated
and soon get archived.

The project is a cargo workspace. It may not be a good practice to
take the whole workspace a repo but anyway this is a toy project.

## Build
`cargo br` for target qemu-system-riscv64 virt machine.

The project is always test on the newest nightly version of Rust.
