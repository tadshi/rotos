# ROTOS
This is a toy operating system in Rust.

This repo is a personal work and a pastime for the author. However, as the author
no loner study Operating System but other fields now, the repo will may not be updated
and soon get archived.

The project is a cargo workspace. It may not be a good practice to
take the whole workspace a repo but anyway this is a toy project.

## Build
The build system is suffering from great change and is unstable now.

This will be kept undocumented until some final decision is made.

The project is always test on the newest nightly version of Rust.
